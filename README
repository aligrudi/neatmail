NEATMAIL
========

Neatmail is a noninteractive mail client.  It generates a listing of
the messages in a mailbox in mbox format and executes a list of
ex-like commands on it.

Neatmail provides the following commands:

* mk: generate a listing of the mails in an mbox.
* ex: execute the specified commands on an mbox.
* pg: page a message in an mbox.
* ns: check for new messages among several mboxes.
* pn: prune an mbox (shorten messages).
* me: MIME-encode message headers.

The ex command reads a list of commands from the standard input and
executes them on a given mbox file.  It ignores all input lines except
those beginning with a colon or a capital letter.  Lines beginning
with a capital letter like "R100 ...", change the value of the status
header of the message whose number follows the letter.  It also marks
the current message.  Lines beginning with a colon are named commands.
The list of named commands are as follows:

* rm: remove the current message.
* cp: copy the current message to the given mbox.
* mv: move the current message to the given mbox.
* hd, set: change the value of the given header of the current message.
* ft, filt: filter the message through the given command.
* w: write the mbox.
* g, g!: ex-like global command.
* tj: join threads by modifying "Reply-To" headers.
* ch: chop the message at the specified offset in kilobytes.

These commands act on the current message by default (if applicable),
but different messages may be specified using ex-like addresses.  For
instance, "2,5rm" removes messages 2 through 5.  Addresses may contain
search statements, like "/pattern/rm", in which the pattern is a POSIX
extended regular expression (the same applies to global command
patterns like "%g/pattern/rm").  Search patterns are matched in the
subject field of message headers, except when the pattern is "^field:
value", in which it is matched against the specified header field
instead.

For instance, in the following example, ex removes message 1, moves
all messages whose subjects match ".*neatmail.*" to mail.mbox file,
and updates the mbox.

$ neatmail ex -b new.mbox <<EOF
O000
O001
:rm
R003
R002
N004
:%g/^subject:.*neatmail.*/mv mail.mbox
:w
EOF

SUGGESTED USAGE
===============

Generate a message listing (see mk options):
$ neatmail mk -st -r -b inbox >inbox.nm

Open inbox.nm in an editor, change the status field of
messages, and append ex commands.

Page, reply, or forward messages (see pg options):
$ neatmail pg -b inbox -i 23 -m -h from: -h subject: -h to: -h cc: >mail

Execute the commands specified in inbox.nm:
$ (cat inbox.nm; echo ":w") | neatmail ex -b inbox

It is more convenient to place these commands in a script.

LARGE MBOXES
============

An mbox can gradually get very large, particularly because of messages
with large attachments.  This makes Neatmail commands slow.  To reduce
the size of such mboxes, I copy old messages to other mbox files using
:mv ex command.  Then, I use the pn command to obtain a smaller
version of this mbox file by removing message bodies and unnecessary
headers (I use a Makefile to update them automatically):

$ neatmail pn -H -s0 <old >old.i

Neatmail commands can read multiple mbox files.  This make it possible
to generate a mail listing using the pruned mbox:

$ neatmail mk -m6 -st -r -b inbox -b old.i >inbox.nm

The -m option forces mk to include the first few letters of the file
that contains this message, like "R0020@old.i", which means the 20th
message in the old.i mbox file (it does so only for files not in the
first file specified with -b).  Like mk, ex and pg commands support
multiple mbox files, each specified using -b.  For pg, it is also
possible to specify message file in the message number.  For instance,
the following command prints the 20th message in old:

$ neatmail pg -i 20@old
